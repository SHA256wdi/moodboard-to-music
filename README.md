# moodboard-to-music ðŸŽµ

This is a personal project that generates a Spotify playlist based on the aesthetic or "vibe" of a Pinterest board. It analyzes images from a Pinterest board using computer vision models and maps the results to mood-based audio features or genres on Spotify.

## Goal

To explore how moodboardsâ€”especially those curated on Pinterestâ€”can translate into sound. This is part of an ongoing interest in creativity, discovery, and building bridges between platforms that evoke emotion in different media (visual vs. auditory).

## Features

- Pulls Pinterest board content (image URLs, titles, etc.)
- Uses image analysis (via CLIP or Google Vision) to identify mood tags
- Maps tags to Spotify genres and audio features
- Generates a mood-matching Spotify playlist

## Stack

- Pinterest API (for board and pin data)
- Spotify API (for playlist creation and track recommendations)
- Python (Flask or Streamlit for basic interface)
- OpenAI CLIP / Google Vision API (for tag extraction from images)

## Status

In development â€” currently building out the MVP and experimenting with tag-to-music mappings.
